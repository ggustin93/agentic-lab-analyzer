## 2. Core Requirements

- **File Upload:** Users must be able to upload PDF or image files of lab reports.
- **Real-time Processing:** Users must see the real-time status of document processing.
- **Data Persistence:** Analysis results must be saved automatically for future access.
- **Structured Display:** Key lab results must be displayed in a clear, structured table.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** An AI-generated summary must explain the results in simple terms.
- **Historical View:** Returning users must be able to see a list of all past analyses.

## 3. Scope

The scope is defined by the user stories in the PRD (US-101 to US-106), focusing on creating a production-grade, single-tenant web application. Multi-user authentication, visual trend analysis, and advanced error recovery are out of scope for MVP v1.1.
