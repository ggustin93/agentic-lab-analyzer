# Product Context: Lab Insight Engine v1.1

## 1. Problem Space

The project addresses the need to create a compelling portfolio piece that directly aligns with the specific technical and professional requirements for a Senior Frontend Engineer role at IBA Dosimetry. It aims to bridge the gap between a simple prototype and a professional, enterprise-ready application that showcases advanced engineering skills.

## 2. Target Audience

The "customer" for this product is the technical review team at IBA Dosimetry, including the Technical Lead and Senior Developers. They are looking for tangible evidence of expertise in building complex, scalable, and maintainable software.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Seamless & Simple:** The user journey, from uploading a document to viewing the analysis, should be intuitive and frictionless.
- **Responsive & Real-time:** The UI must feel alive and responsive, providing immediate feedback during processes like file analysis. **Enhanced with stage-specific progress indicators that show users exactly where they are in the 4-stage processing pipeline (OCR → AI Analysis → Saving → Complete).**
- **Visually Engaging:** **NEW: Color-coded progress system with distinct visual themes for each processing stage - yellow for OCR extraction, blue for AI analysis, purple for saving results, and green for completion. Includes animated spinners, progress dots, and dynamic progress bars.**
- **Transparent Processing:** **NEW: Users can see detailed progress percentages (10%, 50%, 90%, 100%) and understand what's happening at each stage, reducing anxiety during longer processing times.**
- **Informative & Clear:** The presentation of complex health data should be simplified and easy to understand for a non-expert user, supported by clear tables and AI-generated summaries.
- **Polished & Professional:** The application's look and feel should reflect the high standards of a company in the medical technology field, **enhanced with smooth animations and professional color schemes that guide users through the experience.**
