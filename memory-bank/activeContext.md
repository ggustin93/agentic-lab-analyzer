# Active Context: Backend Processing and Supabase Integration

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate focus is on ensuring the backend services are robust and fully functional. We have just completed a major debugging and refactoring effort to stabilize the entire document processing pipeline, from file upload to Supabase data persistence.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **End-to-End Pipeline Fixed:** Resolved a series of cascading bugs in the `DocumentProcessor` service. The application is now able to successfully upload a PDF, process it through the OCR and AI analysis agents, and store all the results correctly in the Supabase database.
- **Database Schema Corrected:** Added missing columns (`storage_path`, `public_url`, `raw_text`, `error_message`, `processed_at`) to the `documents` table in Supabase to align it with the application's data models.
- **Sync/Async Issues Resolved:** Corrected `TypeError` exceptions by removing `await` from what were discovered to be synchronous Supabase client calls.
- **Service Logic Refactored:**
    - Modified the `MistralOCRService` to correctly handle file downloads from URLs instead of expecting local file paths.
    - Simplified the `DocumentProcessor` to use the single `extract_text` method, removing redundant code.
    - Refactored the data-saving logic to use a dedicated `_create_document_record` method for initial insertion, preventing race conditions and `406 Not Acceptable` errors.
- **Serialization Bug Fixed:** Corrected the final `TypeError` by ensuring `datetime` objects were properly serialized to JSON strings using `model_dump(mode='json')` before being sent to the database.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Refactor SSE for Pub/Sub:** Upgrade the existing polling SSE endpoint in `main.py` to use a robust, in-memory pub/sub pattern as previously decided. This aligns with **Task #12 (Performance Optimizations)**.
2.  **Address Security Advisories:** The Supabase advisor flagged that Row-Level Security (RLS) is disabled on public tables. We should enable and configure RLS to secure the database.
3.  **Prioritize Backlog:** Once the SSE refactoring is complete, we will move on to the remaining tasks, including Error Handling, and Documentation.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Strategic Choice for Real-time:** We will continue with the plan to refactor the existing SSE endpoint to use a custom backend pub/sub queue instead of a managed service.
- The `set_task_status` MCP tool is now functional. I will use it to keep the task list synchronized with our progress.
- A significant portion of the work described in the tasks may already exist in the prototype. A thorough code review is needed to align the task list with the actual state of the project.
