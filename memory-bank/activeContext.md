## 2. Recent Changes

### 🔧 **Critical Document Management Fixes (January 2025)**

**✅ COMPLETED: Document Lifecycle Reliability**

1. **Document Loading on Page Refresh - FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Documents didn't load when page was refreshed, even though they existed in database
   - **Solution**: Added `loadDocuments()` call in `DashboardComponent.ngOnInit()` to fetch existing documents on initialization
   - **Impact**: All existing documents now properly display after page refresh

2. **Delete Functionality - FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Documents were only removed from frontend state but not deleted from database, causing them to reappear on refresh
   - **Solution**: Updated `removeDocument()` method to call backend `deleteDocument()` API before updating frontend state
   - **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling with user feedback for failed deletions
   - **Impact**: Documents are now permanently deleted from both database and frontend state

3. **Stuck Document Detection & Recovery System - FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Documents could get stuck in "Starting processing" state with no recovery mechanism
   - **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive retry system with automatic detection, visual indicators, and backend retry API
   - **Features**: 
     - Automatic detection of documents stuck >5 minutes with 0% progress
     - Visual "Retry" buttons with confirmation dialogs
     - Backend `/documents/{id}/retry` endpoint for processing restart
     - Enhanced delete buttons (red styling for error documents)
     - Improved status messages and user feedback

4. **Analysis Page Refresh Loading - FIXED**
   - **Problem**: Refreshing analysis page showed "Document Not Found" even when document existed in database
   - **Solution**: Added document store population on analysis page initialization, similar to dashboard fix
   - **Impact**: Analysis pages now load correctly after page refresh, maintaining proper navigation flow

## 3. Latest Fixes & Infrastructure (Just Completed)

### 🔧 **Critical Database & Backend Fixes** 
1. **✅ Database Schema Fix:** Added missing `progress` and `processing_stage` columns to documents table via Supabase MCP migration
2. **✅ Progress Data Persistence:** Fixed `_save_document_data` method to actually save progress/stage data (was previously ignored)
3. **✅ PROGRESS TRACKING NOW WORKING:** Real-time updates confirmed working with actual progress values (50% ai_analysis → 100% complete)
4. **✅ Pydantic Validation Fix:** Fixed AI returning integer values instead of strings for HealthMarker.value field + auto-conversion
5. **✅ Enhanced Progress Logging:** Added stage-by-stage logging with emojis (📄 OCR → 🧠 AI → 💾 Saving → ✅ Complete)
6. **🔧 Stage 3 Visibility:** Added 0.5s delay for saving_results stage (90%) to ensure users see all 4 stages

### 🎯 **CRITICAL REFERENCE RANGE & HIGHLIGHTING FIXES** (NEW)
7. **✅ Reference Range Source Logic Fixed:** Modified `isReferenceRangeIncomplete()` to be more conservative - only use fallback ranges when OCR truly failed (not just incomplete)
8. **✅ OCR Range Prioritization:** Updated `getDisplayReferenceRange()` to always prioritize OCR-extracted ranges for display, fallback only when OCR extraction completely failed
9. **✅ Out-of-Range Highlighting Fixed:** Created separate `getComparisonReferenceRange()` method that ONLY uses OCR ranges for highlighting - never uses fallback ranges for comparison
10. **✅ Enhanced Visual Feedback:** Added proper CSS classes for yellow (LOW) and red (HIGH) highlighting with left border indicators and improved status badges
11. **✅ Clear Badge Distinction:** "STANDARD" badge now only appears when fallback ranges are used for display, with clear messaging about OCR extraction failure

**Key Principle Implemented:** Reference ranges for out-of-range highlighting come ONLY from OCR extraction. Fallback ranges are used for display only when OCR completely fails to extract any meaningful range.

### Recent Fixes Completed (Dec 2024)

#### Reference Range Logic & Highlighting Fix
**Problem Solved:** Reference ranges were being taken from fallback medical standards instead of OCR data, and "out of range" highlighting wasn't working properly.

**Changes Made:**

1. **Enhanced Reference Range Detection (lab-marker-info.service.ts)**:
   - Made `isReferenceRangeIncomplete()` more conservative - only considers truly failed extractions
   - Removed triggers for incomplete ranges like "..." or "depending" to trust OCR more
   - Only uses fallback ranges when OCR completely fails (empty, "N/A", "error", very short strings)

2. **PURE OCR DATA DISPLAY (data-table.component.ts)**:
   - **CRITICAL CHANGE**: Extracted data table now shows ONLY OCR-extracted ranges - NEVER fallback ranges
   - **Display**: `getDisplayReferenceRange()` returns ONLY what OCR extracted (empty string if nothing extracted)
   - **Comparison**: `getComparisonReferenceRange()` ONLY uses OCR ranges for highlighting
   - **Removed**: "STANDARD" badges and all fallback range indicators from table display
   - **Fallback Usage**: Medical standard ranges now ONLY used in tooltips for reference information

3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback (global_styles.css)**:
   - Added `.highlight-low` and `.highlight-high` classes with amber/red backgrounds and left borders
   - Updated status badges with consistent CSS classes and improved styling
   - Changed "WATCH" label to "LOW" for better clarity

4. **Agent Improvements (chutes_ai_agent.py)**:
   - **Enhanced System Prompt**: Added comprehensive guidance for reference range extraction
     - Examples of common range formats (3.5-5.0, < 2.0, Normal: 65-100, etc.)
     - Instructions to preserve exact text from documents
     - Clear guidance on handling unclear or missing ranges
     - Unit handling and context clue instructions
     - Quality over quantity emphasis
   - **Quality Monitoring**: Added logging to track extraction success rates and identify missing ranges

**Impact:** 
- **Data Integrity**: Table displays ONLY what was actually extracted from documents by OCR
- **No Contamination**: Zero fallback data mixed into extracted results
- **Clear Separation**: Fallback ranges available only in tooltips for medical reference
- **User Trust**: Users see exactly what the system detected, nothing added or modified

#### Agent Prompt Enhancement (chutes_ai_agent.py)
**Problem:** Agent occasionally confused "Normes" (reference ranges) with "Résultats Antérieurs" (previous results) columns.

**Solution:**
- **Column Identification Rules**: Added specific guidance to distinguish between reference ranges, previous results, and current values
- **Examples**: Provided concrete examples showing correct vs incorrect extraction
- **Clear Instructions**: Added rules to never use previous results as reference ranges
- **Quality Requirements**: Enhanced requirements for preserving exact reference range formatting

**Impact**: Improved accuracy of reference range extraction, reducing confusion between medical standards and historical patient data.

1. **Monitor Agent Performance**: Watch logs for reference range extraction rates after the prompt improvements

## Next Steps & Considerations

1. **Monitor Agent Performance**: Watch logs for reference range extraction rates after the prompt improvements
2. **User Testing**: Validate that the visual highlighting clearly indicates out-of-range values
3. **Performance**: Monitor if the enhanced agent prompt affects processing speed 

### Recent Bug Fix (Dec 2024)

#### JSON Parsing Error Fix (chutes_ai_agent.py)
**Problem:** Invalid control character errors when parsing Chutes AI responses causing document processing failures.

**Solution:**
- **JSON Cleaning Function**: Added `clean_json_string()` to remove invalid control characters (null bytes, non-printable chars)
- **Safe Parsing**: Added `safe_json_parse()` with fallback cleaning when direct parsing fails
- **Robust Error Handling**: Better exception handling with detailed logging for debugging
- **Structure Validation**: Added validation to ensure expected JSON structure before processing
- **Individual Marker Handling**: Made marker creation more resilient by handling individual failures
- **Fallback Values**: Added default values for missing optional fields

**Impact:** Document processing now handles malformed AI responses gracefully without failing completely.
