Works on MyQaion web application, used as quality assessment tool for proton therapy. 
This last one allows to threat patient cancer with no side effect unlike traditional radiotherapy.
MyQaion ensures that the right treatment is delivered to the patient ( dose verification, angle of irradiation, etc).
My role is to support the dev team by providing guidance on technical challenges they are facing (approach/design, choice of framework/library, best practice, code review), implement new features but also reduce the complexity of their existing code base.
From to time to time I’m a scrum facilitator.

Driving architecture decisions for the project, involved in the architecture board of the department.

Technologies : Java 17, Angular 14, Spring Boot 3.X, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate 6.X, Rest ( Richardson level 3), Open Api V3, Grpc, Websocket, Junit, TestContainer, Postgres, Docker, Maven, Gitlab,Flyway.
Others : transition to clean architecture, C4 documentation
