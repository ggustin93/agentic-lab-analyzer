Salut!

L’entretien technique c’est généralement avec le tech lead ou un dévelopeur senior. Les connaissant, je ne pense pas qu’ils posent des questions vraiment de programmation bas-niveau mais je sais qu’ils accordent une grande importance à la façon de structurer le code, stratégies de testing, principe d’architecture (eg. clean architecture - peut-être moins a propos pour le front), …

Au niveau des versions on cherche à rester sur les plus récentes : la 19 pour Angular et on vise la 20 bientôt.

 

Bon w-e,

 

Sylvain
